Probabilistic Forecasting and Uncertainty Quantification
This repository explores various techniques for generating probabilistic forecasts and quantifying uncertainty in machine learning models. The primary focus is on moving beyond single-point predictions to generate prediction intervals and full predictive distributions.

🚀 About The Project
In many real-world applications, knowing the uncertainty associated with a prediction is as important as the prediction itself. This project provides practical implementations and comparisons of several key methods for uncertainty quantification, implemented in Jupyter Notebooks.

🛠️ Methods Explored
This project demonstrates the following key techniques:

Quantile Regression: A regression method that estimates the conditional quantiles of the response variable, allowing for the direct generation of prediction intervals.

Conformal Predictions: A model-agnostic framework that can be wrapped around any point-prediction model to provide statistically rigorous prediction intervals with guaranteed coverage.

Probabilistic Distribution: Techniques where the model's output is not a single value but the parameters of a probability distribution (e.g., Mean and Standard Deviation for a Normal distribution), allowing for a full characterization of uncertainty.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Essential for optimizing the performance of the models used in the above techniques.

🏁 Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or higher
pip
Installation
Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/DaneshSelwal/your-repository-name.git
cd your-repository-name
(Note: Please replace your-repository-name with the actual name of your repository.)

Install required packages:
It is recommended to create a virtual environment first.

Bash

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Then, install the dependencies:

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
(Note: You will need to create a requirements.txt file by running pip freeze > requirements.txt in your project's environment.)

Usage
Navigate to any of the directories and launch Jupyter Notebook to explore the implementations:

Bash

jupyter notebook
